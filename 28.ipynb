    "A box plot, also known as a box-and-whisker plot, is commonly used to display data in terms of range. Box plots provide a visual summary of the distribution of a dataset, including key measures such as the median, quartiles (first quartile, Q1, and third quartile, Q3), and potential outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how a box plot represents data in terms of range:\n",
    "\n",
    "Box (Interquartile Range, IQR): The box in the middle of the plot spans the interquartile range (IQR), which represents the middle 50% of the data. The lower boundary of the box is Q1 (the 25th percentile), and the upper boundary is Q3 (the 75th percentile). The length of the box represents the spread of the central portion of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median (Q2): A line inside the box represents the median (Q2), which is the middle value when the data is sorted. The median indicates the center of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whiskers: Lines extending from the box, known as whiskers, reach out to the minimum and maximum data values within a certain range. The whiskers show the spread of the entire dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outliers: Individual data points that fall significantly outside the whiskers are typically considered outliers and are displayed as individual points on the plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Box plots are useful for visually assessing the range of data, identifying skewness, and spotting potential outliers. They provide a concise summary of the spread and central tendency of a dataset, making them valuable for data exploration and comparison across different groups or categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Box plots can be particularly effective when comparing the ranges and distributions of multiple datasets side by side, making them a valuable tool in data analysis and visualization."
