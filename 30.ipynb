    "Common measures of central tendency and variability are essential tools in statistics for summarizing and understanding datasets. Here are some common measures of central tendency and variability, along with explanations of how each measure can be used to describe a dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of Central Tendency:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean (Average):\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean is the sum of all values in a dataset divided by the number of values.\n",
    "It represents the typical or average value in the dataset.\n",
    "Use: The mean provides a measure of central tendency and helps answer questions like \"What is the typical value in the dataset?\" It's sensitive to extreme values (outliers).\n",
    "Median:\n",
    "\n",
    "The median is the middle value in a dataset when values are arranged in ascending or descending order.\n",
    "It is less affected by outliers compared to the mean.\n",
    "Use: The median is a robust measure of central tendency that's useful when there are outliers or skewed distributions.\n",
    "Mode:\n",
    "\n",
    "The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset.\n",
    "A dataset can have no mode (all values occur with equal frequency), one mode (unimodal), or multiple modes (multimodal).\n",
    "Use: The mode helps identify the most common value(s) in the dataset, especially in categorical or discrete datasets.\n",
    "Measures of Variability (Dispersion):\n",
    "\n",
    "Range:\n",
    "\n",
    "The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset.\n",
    "It provides a simple measure of the spread of data.\n",
    "Use: The range gives an idea of how much the data values vary from the lowest to the highest.\n",
    "Variance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance measures the average squared difference between each data point and the mean.\n",
    "It quantifies the spread or dispersion of data points.\n",
    "Use: Variance provides a precise measure of data variability. A higher variance indicates greater spread.\n",
    "Standard Deviation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.\n",
    "It measures the average deviation from the mean and has the same units as the data.\n",
    "Use: The standard deviation is commonly used for describing the spread of data. It's useful for comparing variability between datasets.\n",
    "Interquartile Range (IQR):\n",
    "\n",
    "The IQR is the difference between the third quartile (Q3) and the first quartile (Q1) of a dataset.\n",
    "It represents the middle 50% of the data and is robust to outliers.\n",
    "Use: The IQR is a robust measure of variability, often used in box plots and to identify potential outliers.\n",
    "Coefficient of Variation (CV):\n",
    "\n",
    "The CV is the standard deviation divided by the mean, expressed as a percentage.\n",
    "It measures relative variability and is useful for comparing variability between datasets with different units or scales.\n",
    "Use: The CV helps assess the relative variability of datasets, especially in fields like finance and biology.\n",
    "These measures of central tendency and variability are valuable for summarizing, comparing, and interpreting datasets in various fields, including science, economics, social sciences, and more. The choice of which measure to use depends on the characteristics of the data and the specific questions being addressed in the analysis."
